# Old-Work-Hour-Calculator-2024
The first hour calculator I made for my work at UW-Madison. Takes a students hours from a google sheet over the month and calculates their total number of hours. Also calculates the total number of hours per week for budgeting reasons. Was retired in Janurary of 2025 in favor of a better system for my manager.

Additionally, an example of the google form and the google sheet created from the google form is attached to better understand the structure of the data that the calculator worked with.
